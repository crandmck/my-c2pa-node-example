# my-c2pa-node-example

A simple Node.js app using Express and Multer for handling file uploads. This app will save the uploaded images in a directory named uploads and then display them.

To run this app, install the required packages by entering this command:

```
npm install express multer
```

Then, start the server with:

```
node app.js
```

NOTE: This is a very basic implementation and doesn’t include error handling or security measures, so it’s not suitable for a production environment. Always ensure you handle file uploads securely when building real-world applications.

The HTML file contains a form for uploading images and a script for fetching and displaying the images. The images are fetched from the `/images` endpoint and displayed in the images `div`. Please note that you’ll need to implement the `/images` endpoint in your Node.js server to return a list of the uploaded images. This is a basic implementation and may need to be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

Remember to place this HTML file in a directory that is served by your Express app, or adjust the action URL in the form to point to your server’s location. You can serve static files in Express using the `express.static `middleware. For example, if you put your HTML file in a directory named `public`, you can serve it with `app.use(express.static('public'))`. Then, you can access the HTML file at <http://localhost:3000/yourfile.html>.
